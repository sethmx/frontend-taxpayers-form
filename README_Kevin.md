# Assumptions

Assumptions about the behavior of the Taxpayer Registration Form functionality can assume how the form should behave in certain scenarios based on the requirements provided, even if they are not explicitly stated.
Assumptions about styling requirements: You can assume certain layout choices or style preferences based on the mention of Tailwind CSS to style the form.
Supposed.

I assumed it could be done in any framework.
